# P2P File Transfer

## Overview

This is a small project to help solve a problem that should've been solved by now: file transfer.

For in-person file transfers, we have lots of solutions: Google's Nearby Share and Apple's Airdrop are good examples. But for long-distance ones, the best we've been able to do is just upload the content to a third-party server for everyone to download from. This is simply wasteful and costly.

Why not just put the huge amount of resources residential Internet users get to use and DIY it?

## Tech

It is being coded in Rust in order to get both safety and performance

## Status

Alpha: I am basically learning network programming through this. This is in NO way usable right now.
